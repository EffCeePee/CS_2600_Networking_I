0	230	Home Subnet.Linksys Cable Modem Router	Results	OSPF	Unexpected_Results	BEHAVIOUR/RESULT(S): <NL> All OSPF models have been configured to <NL> operate in SIMULATION EFFICIENCY mode. In <NL> this mode, OSPF on all router nodes will <NL> shut down operation after simulation time <NL> 260.000000 seconds. <NL>   <NL> This is the value to which the <NL> "OSPF Stop Time" simulation attribute <NL> is set. <NL>   <NL> This mode is used to reduce the overall <NL> time taken to run the simulation and <NL> should be used only when: <NL> 1. The state of links and IP router nodes <NL>    in the network does not change over <NL>    the course of the simulation. <NL> 2. The load on the network as a result <NL>    of running OSPF is not of interest. <NL>   <NL> POSSIBLE CAUSE(S): <NL> The "OSPF Sim Efficiency" simulation <NL> attribute is set to "Enabled". <NL>   <NL> SUGGESTIONS: <NL> If either of the two conditions above <NL> do not apply to your study, set "OSPF <NL> Sim Efficiency" to "Disabled" and <NL> rerun your simulation. <NL>  
0	230	Home Subnet.Linksys Cable Modem Router	Config.	OSPF	Model_Configuration_Warning	WARNING: <NL>   The area id for loopback interface 192.0.2.1 <NL>   was not specified, or is invalid. <NL>   This loopback is being configured in  <NL>   area 0.0.0.0 <NL>   <NL> POSSIBLE CAUSE(s): <NL>   1. The area id was not configured for this <NL>      loopback interface. <NL>   2. The area id configured for this loopback <NL>      interface is not a valid area id. A valid <NL>      area id is one that has been configured on <NL>      a physical interface, in the Interface <NL>      Information Table under OSPF Parameters. <NL>   <NL> SUGGESTIONS: <NL>   Make sure that a valid area id is configured <NL>   for every loopback interface configured to run <NL>   OSPF. The area id for a loopback interface can <NL>   be specified in the Loopback Interfaces attribute <NL>   under OSPF Parameters. <NL>   <NL> << This message will not be repeated for other loopback interfaces. >> <NL>

2412.28251749	54551	Home Subnet.Web and Email Server	Protocol	TCP	Data_Transmission	SYMPTOM(S): <NL>  TCP RST received for invalid connection <NL>  Packet destroyed <NL>   <NL>  This message will not be repeated <NL>   <NL> POSSIBLE CAUSES: <NL>  RST was for connection which <NL>  had already closed and timed-out <NL>   <NL>  This is normal protocol behavior <NL>  for TCP, following retransmissions <NL>  and subsequent ACKs being sent <NL>   <NL> SUGGESTIONS: <NL>  Check the Simulation Log for <NL>  retransmissions, which indicate <NL>  possible long delays
2414.5	54718	Home Subnet.PC2 Researcher	Protocol	TCP	Data_Transmission	SYMPTOM(S): <NL>  TCP is retransmitting data segments <NL>  which will cause additional overhead <NL>  on the lower layers and links <NL>   <NL> CAUSE(S): <NL>  This may be normal behavior on a  <NL>  network which has either: <NL>  1) Slow links <NL>  2) Possibly dropped packets (ATM or FR) <NL>  3) Queuing delays <NL>   <NL> SUGGESTIONS: <NL>  If any of the causes listed above are <NL>  expected, no action is required, as <NL>  this is normal protocol behavior for <NL>  TCP <NL>   <NL>  Otherwise look for problems in the <NL>  lower layers, such as IP dropped  <NL>  packets or other errors in the  <NL>  simulation log <NL>   <NL>  View TCP response time statistics <NL>  for data regarding the delays <NL>   <NL> This message will not be repeated <NL>  
28800	663438	N/A	Config.	Event Manager	Performance	Try setting the 'event_speed_parameter' preference to (200005). <NL>   <NL> The advanced event management system in the Simulation <NL> Kernel can be tuned to maintain peak performance when <NL> simulating very large systems. Your trade-off is that <NL> higher values of event_speed_parameter require <NL> additional memory. <NL>   <NL> Optimal values depend on the type and size of models, <NL> so the value above is an estimate based on how this <NL> simulation performed. You may wish to experiment <NL> with different values and compare the simulation's <NL> performance. In general, increasing this parameter <NL> will not yield significant performance gains for small, <NL> lightly-loaded systems. <NL>
